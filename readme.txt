== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this different from regular plugins? =

Agents are like plugins but specifically designed for AI-powered automation. They follow a standard structure, can register tools for AI models to use, and integrate with the Agentic approval and audit system.

= Can I build my own agents? =

Yes! Agents follow a simple structure similar to WordPress plugins. Create an agent.php file with headers, register your tools, and share with the community.

= Where should I install my custom agents? =

Install custom agents in `wp-content/agents/` directory (not inside the plugin folder). This ensures your agents survive plugin updates. The plugin comes with 10 bundled agents in `wp-content/plugins/agentic-plugin/library/` that update with the plugin, but your custom agents in `wp-content/agents/` will never be touched during updates.

= Is this production ready? =

Agentic Plugin is currently in beta. The core functionality is stable and ready for testing in production environments. We recommend thorough testing before deploying on critical sites.

= Which AI providers are supported? =

Currently supports OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), and local models via Ollama.

= Is my data sent to external services? =

Only when using cloud AI providers. Local model support is available for privacy-sensitive deployments.
