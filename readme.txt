Build and manage AI agents directly in WordPress — no coding required. Describe what you want, and let AI create powerful automations for content, admin, e-commerce, and more.

== Description ==

Agent Builder turns WordPress into an AI-agent ecosystem — similar to how plugins and themes extend your site, but powered by large language models (LLMs).

Describe your desired AI agent in natural language, and the plugin builds it for you. Install, activate, and manage agents just like regular plugins. Browse a growing library of community agents or create your own.

Key benefits:
- No-code agent creation via chat interface
- Multi-provider support: OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), local models (Ollama), and more
- Plugin-style management: install, activate, deactivate, delete
- Built-in safeguards: audit logs, human-in-the-loop approvals, rate limiting, cost controls
- Extensible: developers can build custom agents with tools and share them

= Agent Categories =
- **Content** — Drafting, SEO optimization, translation, alt text generation
- **Admin** — Security monitoring, backups, performance tuning
- **E-commerce** — Product management, pricing optimization, inventory
- **Frontend** — Visitor chat, comment moderation, support
- **Developer** — Code generation, debugging, theme/plugin building
- **Marketing** — Campaigns, multi-platform content

= Requirements =
- WordPress 6.4+
- PHP 8.1+
- MySQL 8.0 / MariaDB 10.6+

== Installation ==

1. Search for "Agent Builder" in **Plugins → Add New** and install it (or upload the ZIP via **Add New → Upload Plugin**).
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Go to **Agentic → Settings** in the WordPress admin menu.
4. Enter your AI provider API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) or configure local models.
5. Visit **Agentic → Agents** to browse/install pre-built agents.
6. Activate any agent to enable its features on your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this differ from regular WordPress plugins? =
Agents are AI-powered automations that follow a standardized structure. They register tools the LLM can call, integrate with approval workflows, and are managed like plugins (activate/deactivate/delete).

= Can I create my own agents? =
Yes. Create an `agent.php` file with standard headers, register tools/functions, and place it in `wp-content/agents/`. The plugin auto-discovers them. Share your agents with the community!

= Where do custom agents go? =
Place custom agents in `wp-content/agents/` (outside the plugin folder). This keeps them safe during updates. Bundled demo agents live in the plugin's `library/` folder.

= Is my data sent to external AI services? =
Only if using cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Use local models via Ollama for full privacy. All external calls are logged and rate-limited.

= Is it production-ready? =
Version 1.1.0+ is stable with strong security (no exec(), nonces, escaping), GDPR-compliant uninstall, and audit logging. Test thoroughly on staging first.

= Which AI providers work? =
xAI (GROK), OpenAI (GPT models), Anthropic (Claude), local Ollama models. More coming soon.
