### Creating a Test Agent

Quick way to test the system:

   ```php
   <?php
   /**
    * Agent Name: Test Demo
    * Description: Simple test agent
    * Version: 1.0.0
    * Author: You
    * License: GPL v2 or later
    */

   namespace Agentic\Agents;

   class Test_Demo extends \Agentic\Agent_Base {
       public function get_name(): string {
           return 'Test Demo';
       }

       public function get_description(): string {
           return 'A simple test agent';
       }

       public function get_tools(): array {
           return [
               'demo_tool' => 'A test tool'
           ];
       }

       public function handle_request(string $input): string {
           return "You said: $input";
