## What Should Be Removed from Website

You can now safely delete these pages from agentic-plugin.com:

- `/roadmap/` (overview page - keep a redirect to wiki)
- `/roadmap/executive-summary/`
- `/roadmap/core-architecture/`
- `/roadmap/backend-capabilities/`
- `/roadmap/frontend-capabilities/`
- `/roadmap/plugin-architecture/`
- `/roadmap/theme-architecture/`
- `/roadmap/security-guardrails/`
- `/roadmap/data-flow/`
- `/roadmap/rest-api/`
- `/roadmap/use-cases/`
- `/roadmap/migration-path/`
- `/roadmap/discussion-points/`
- `/roadmap/roadmap/`

**Recommended replacement:**

Create a simple redirect page at `/roadmap/` that says:

```markdown
# Roadmap

Our roadmap documentation has moved to the GitHub Wiki for easier 
community collaboration and updates.

**→ [View Roadmap on GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/renduples/agent-builder/wiki/Roadmap)**
