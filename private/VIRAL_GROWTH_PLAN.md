## 📱 Content Strategy (Week 1-2)

### Twitter/X - Thread Campaign

**Thread 1: Announce Launch**
```
🚀 Just open-sourced Agentic Plugin - The AI agent marketplace for WordPress

What if WordPress devs could build once & earn from 500K+ sites?

A 🧵 on why this changes everything 👇
```
[Share link to repo, star this!]

**Thread 2: The 10 agents showcase**
```
Built 10 production-ready AI agents for WordPress:

1. 🔍 SEO Analyzer - Auto audits on-page optimization
2. ✍️ Content Assistant - Draft & optimize posts
3. 📦 Product Describer - WooCommerce descriptions
4. 📱 Social Media - Auto-generate social content
5. 🛡️ Security Monitor - Vulnerability scanning
... (5 more)

Each agent is $29-99/month. All open source & GPL. 

Thread 🧵
```

**Thread 3: The Economics**
```
Most plugins die because there's no incentive to build them.

With Agentic:
- Build agent in 1 week
- $12K+/year per 50 customers
- 70% revenue share (highest in WordPress)
- 500K+ sites to sell to
- Zero upfront cost to start

This is the gold rush moment for WordPress devs.
